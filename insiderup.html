<h1>Are you ready to #InsiderUp?</h1> 

<p>We believe that everyone in the world should have the opportunity to learn coding skills, whether they’re a student, happily settled in a job…or think it’s too late to upskill. Our Windows Insider community has of course raised their hands to help make this mission happen for 7.7 billion people across the world.</p>

<p>We’re happy to share our favorite Microsoft learning tools as well as a few experimental Insider-led projects that utilize the latest in Microsoft tech that will help the people you care about learn coding skills: IT pros, military veterans, young people, former full time parents wanting to get back to work, retired folks, … anyone else you think would benefit from upskilling the superpowers you already have. </p>

<p>We’d like to offer you an exclusive opportunity to try these projects in pre-release mode to give us feedback before they roll out to the whole world.</p>
